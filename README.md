## This project aims to determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers

##### I have used the following classification models:
 * Decision Tree Classifier
 * Logistic Regression Classifier
 * k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
 * Support Vector Machine Classifier
 * Naive Bayes Classifier
 * Random Forest Classifier
